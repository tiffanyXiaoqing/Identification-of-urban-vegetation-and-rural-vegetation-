# Identification of urban vegetation and rural vegetation
## Introduction
This repo is about an algorithm of identification of urban vegetation and rural vegetation. All the images are based on high resolution remote sensing images. This is an detail version based on [mriiiron-urban-rural-vegetation](https://github.com/mriiiron/urban-rural-vegetation).
## Todo
First, preprocessing the high-resolution remote sensing images and using the supervised classification algorithm--SVM, on the ERDAS IMAGINE 9.2 platform to classify the complex images into four categories. <br> 
Then, you can try the code in src. Download package `Opencv` and `GDAL` before running.<br>
## More information about how to realize it
If you are familar with English, you can refer to the `Mathematical principle and explaination file`. For Chinese, you can refer to `城市和乡村绿地的判别原理` file.
